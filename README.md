A simple net present value calculator that will allow you to estimate the intrinsic value of one share of a business.
The user must use the 10-K of the business they wish to evaluate to get 4 important inputs, in millions:
1) Shares
2) Net Income
3) Cash
4) Debt

Then, the user must pick a 10-year estimated growth rate, a perpetual growth rate (next 100 years), and a discount rate.
The program then returns the value of the discounted future cash flows, per share.
